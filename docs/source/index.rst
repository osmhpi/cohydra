testbed - It's A Testbed! :)
============================

testbed is a hybrid testbed for simulating networks and fault-injection.

It uses the `ns-3 <https://www.nsnam.org>`_ simulator and connects containers and external hardware to the simulated network.
By its fault-injection-API, the simulation can be manipulated in scenarios.
